1. Copy the 10 input files in a folder named "input"

2. Place the input folder in the "spark-2.0.0-bin-hadoop2.7" directory which you unzipped after downloading.

3. Copy the "mapper.py" file in the "spark-2.0.0-bin-hadoop2.7" directory.

4. Please delete any folder named "output" or "output_piyushz" in the spark-2.0.0-bin-hadoop2.7 directory.

5. Run the below command:
./bin/spark-submit mapper.py


6. There would be 2 output directories created. 
The Final Output would be in the Directory "output_piyushz"



Please mail me if you face any issues while running it.


I've also attached the output file which I got after running the mapper.py

. 
Please open the output file with wordpad for better viewing if you are opening it in windows.

Thank you.
